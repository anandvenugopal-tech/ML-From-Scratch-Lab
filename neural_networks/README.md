# Neural Network From Scratch 

This project implements a **fully connected neural network from scratch using NumPy**,
without using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The goal of this project is to **understand the mathematics and mechanics behind neural
networks**, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
